demo5 - AKA qedit
-----------------

This is a small text editor, single file, single window. Very keyboard
oriented, which puts the document you are editing in the front. This is a small
replacement for Notepad.exe, or Notepad on steroids. This demo not only
shows how to use the text editor widget, but also how to incorporate 
your synax highlighter into the code.

Extra features:
 - Smart home/end
   * Pressing home will not bring to to the start to the line, but 
     to the first non blank char in the line
   * Pressing end will not bring to to the end to the line, but 
     to the last non blank char in the line
   * If you are in the smart home/end position and you press the corresponding
     key again, you get to the real home/end position.
 - If a line is modified since the editor is opened, the line number will be colored
 - Non intrusive motifications
   * If the opened file is read only, you get a banner telling you that
   * The banner will contain a link to make the document read-write
   * If the file is deleted outside the editor, you will get a banner telling you that
   * Same if the file is modified outside the editor, but banner will also include
     a link to reload the file
   * All banners auto close after 15 seconds (some less)
